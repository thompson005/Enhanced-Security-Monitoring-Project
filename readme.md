# Security Vulnerability Monitoring System

## Overview
The **Security Vulnerability Monitoring System** is a comprehensive solution designed to collect, analyze, and correlate vulnerability data from various sources. The system provides real-time monitoring of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), exploits, and security advisories, enabling effective threat assessment and prioritization.

## Features
- **Real-time CVE Monitoring**: Continuously fetches and updates CVE data from multiple sources.
- **Automated Severity Analysis**: Implements custom algorithms to assess the severity of vulnerabilities.
- **Vulnerability Trend Analysis**: Identifies and reports trends in vulnerabilities over time.
- **Integration with Data Sources**: Collects data from various sources such as CVE, Exploit-DB, and GitHub Security Advisories.
- **Elastic Stack Integration**: Utilizes the ELK stack for data visualization and monitoring.
- **Automated Alerting System**: Notifies users of critical vulnerabilities in real-time.

## Architecture
The system architecture follows a modular design that includes:

Collectors -> Enrichment -> Analysis -> Storage -> Visualization │ │ │ │ │ └─ CVE └─ CWE └─ Severity └─ Elastic └─ Kibana └─ ExploitDB └─ ThreatInt └─ Trends └─ JSON └─ GitHub Sec └─ MITRE └─ Correl.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Data Storage**: Elasticsearch
- **Data Collection**: Requests library for API interaction
- **Logging**: Custom logging utility
- **Containerization**: Docker (for deploying ELK stack)
- **Testing**: Pytest

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose (for ELK stack)
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps to Install

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/security-vulnerability-monitoring-system.git
   cd security-vulnerability-monitoring-system
Install Python Dependencies Install the required Python packages using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up the Configuration Copy the example configuration file and edit it with your settings:

bash
Copy code
cp config/collectors_config.yaml.example config/collectors_config.yaml
Start the Elastic Stack Use Docker Compose to run the ELK stack:

bash
Copy code
cd config
docker-compose up -d
Run the Collector Execute the CVE collector to start gathering vulnerability data:

bash
Copy code
python -m src.collectors.cve_collector
API Endpoints
The system exposes several API endpoints for interaction:

Collect CVEs
Endpoint: /api/collect
Method: POST
Description: Collects CVEs from configured sources.
Analyze Severity
Endpoint: /api/analyze
Method: POST
Description: Analyzes the severity of collected CVEs.
Request Body:
json
Copy code
{
    "cves": [...]
}
Status Check
Endpoint: /api/status
Method: GET
Description: Returns the status of the monitoring system.
Running Tests
To ensure the system functions as intended, run the test suite:

bash
Copy code
python -m pytest tests/
