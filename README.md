# Security Vulnerability Monitoring System

## Overview
The **Security Vulnerability Monitoring System** is an all-in-one solution designed to monitor, collect, analyze, and correlate vulnerability data from various sources in real time. The system aims to empower organizations and individuals with timely, actionable insights into vulnerabilities, enabling better risk management and response to security threats.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time CVE Monitoring**: Continuously fetches the latest Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) data, keeping you informed of new security threats.
- **Automated Severity Analysis**: Evaluates the severity of vulnerabilities with custom algorithms, assisting with prioritization based on risk level.
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifies trends in vulnerabilities, providing insights into the evolution of security threats over time.
- **Integrated Data Sources**: Collects data from multiple reputable sources, including CVE databases, Exploit-DB, and GitHub Security Advisories, ensuring a comprehensive view of potential threats.
- **Elastic Stack Visualization**: Employs Elasticsearch and Kibana to visualize and monitor vulnerability data for an intuitive and actionable overview.
- **Automated Alerting**: Notifies users of critical vulnerabilities in real time, helping with rapid response and mitigation.

## Architecture
The system follows a modular architecture composed of distinct components, each responsible for specific functionality:

```
Collectors -> Enrichment -> Analysis -> Storage -> Visualization
    │            │            │           │           │
    └─ CVE      └─ CWE       └─ Severity └─ Elastic  └─ Kibana
    └─ ExploitDB └─ ThreatInt └─ Trends   └─ JSON
    └─ GitHub Sec └─ MITRE    └─ Correl.
```

### Component Details
- **Data Collectors**: Retrieve vulnerability data from sources like CVE databases, Exploit-DB, and GitHub Security Advisories.
- **Data Enrichment**: Enhances data with contextual information, e.g., adding CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) details or threat intelligence.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzes vulnerability severity and trends over time, detecting correlation patterns among different data points.
- **Data Storage**: Stores the data in Elasticsearch for fast retrieval and analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Uses Kibana for dashboards and reporting, enabling users to view and interpret vulnerability insights.

## ELK Process
The integration of the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) is critical for effective data visualization and monitoring in this system:

1. **Elasticsearch**: Serves as the search and analytics engine where all vulnerability data is stored. Its powerful querying capabilities allow for efficient data retrieval and analysis.
   
2. **Logstash**: Acts as a data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources, transforms it, and then sends it to Elasticsearch. In this project, Logstash can be configured to parse the collected vulnerability data into a format suitable for Elasticsearch.

3. **Kibana**: Provides a web-based interface for visualizing and exploring the data stored in Elasticsearch. Users can create custom dashboards and visualizations to monitor vulnerabilities and trends effectively.

## Kibana Visualization Features
The system provides comprehensive visualization capabilities through Kibana:

### Dashboard Components
- **Vulnerability Timeline**: Interactive timeline showing vulnerability discoveries and updates over time
- **Severity Distribution**: Pie charts and heat maps displaying the distribution of vulnerability severity levels
- **Trend Analysis Graphs**: Line and area charts showing vulnerability trends across different categories
- **Geographic Distribution**: World map visualization of vulnerability impacts by region
- **Source Distribution**: Breakdown of vulnerabilities by source (CVE, Exploit-DB, GitHub, etc.)

### Custom Visualizations
1. **Security Metrics Dashboard**:
   - CVSS score distribution
   - Vulnerability age analysis
   - Affected systems overview
   - Resolution status tracking

2. **Threat Intelligence View**:
   - Real-time threat indicators
   - Correlation between different vulnerabilities
   - Attack vector analysis
   - Impact assessment metrics

3. **Operational Dashboards**:
   - Active vulnerability count
   - Remediation progress tracking
   - Team performance metrics
   - SLA compliance monitoring

### Interactive Features
- **Real-time Filtering**: Dynamic filtering of data based on multiple criteria
- **Drill-down Capabilities**: Ability to dive deep into specific vulnerability details
- **Custom Time Ranges**: Flexible time range selection for trend analysis
- **Export Options**: Data export in multiple formats (CSV, PDF, PNG)
- **Automated Reports**: Scheduled report generation and distribution

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python
- **Data Storage and Search**: Elasticsearch
- **Data Collection**: requests library for API interactions
- **Logging**: Custom logging utility for improved traceability
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose to simplify setup and deployment
- **Testing**: Pytest for automated testing and quality assurance
