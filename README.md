# Security Vulnerability Monitoring System

## Overview
The **Security Vulnerability Monitoring System** is a comprehensive solution designed to monitor, collect, analyze, and correlate vulnerability data from various sources in real time. The system aims to empower organizations and individuals with timely, actionable insights into vulnerabilities, enabling better risk management and response to security threats.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time CVE Monitoring**: Continuously fetches the latest Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) data, keeping you informed of new security threats.
- **Automated Severity Analysis**: Evaluates the severity of vulnerabilities with custom algorithms, assisting with prioritization based on risk level.
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifies trends in vulnerabilities, providing insights into the evolution of security threats over time.
- **Integrated Data Sources**: Collects data from multiple reputable sources, including CVE databases, Exploit-DB, and GitHub Security Advisories.
- **Elastic Stack Visualization**: Leverages Elasticsearch and Kibana for visualizing and monitoring vulnerability data, providing intuitive dashboards and reports.
- **Automated Alerting**: Notifies users of critical vulnerabilities in real time, facilitating rapid response and mitigation.

## Architecture
The system follows a modular architecture composed of distinct components, each responsible for specific functionality:

- **Data Collectors**: Retrieve vulnerability data from sources like CVE databases, Exploit-DB, and GitHub Security Advisories.
- **Data Enrichment**: Enhances data with contextual information, such as adding Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) details or threat intelligence.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzes vulnerability severity and trends over time, detecting correlation patterns among different data points.
- **Data Storage**: Stores the collected data in Elasticsearch, enabling fast retrieval and powerful search capabilities.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilizes Kibana for creating dashboards and reporting, allowing users to view and interpret vulnerability insights effectively.

## ELK Stack Integration
The integration of the **Elastic Stack** is a key focus of this project. The ELK components are utilized to ensure effective data ingestion, storage, and visualization:

### Elasticsearch
- **Purpose**: Acts as the primary data storage solution, allowing for powerful searching and indexing of vulnerability data.
- **Functionality**: Enables fast querying and filtering of vulnerabilities, making it easier to analyze and understand data trends.

### Logstash (Future Implementation)
- **Purpose**: Designed for data processing and ingestion.
- **Functionality**: Will be implemented to process raw data before sending it to Elasticsearch. Logstash can handle various data sources and formats, transforming and enriching the data as necessary.

### Kibana
- **Purpose**: Serves as the front-end visualization tool for Elasticsearch.
- **Functionality**: Enables users to create interactive dashboards, visualize trends, and monitor real-time data. Kibana provides powerful filtering and searching capabilities, making it an essential tool for analyzing security vulnerabilities.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python
- **Data Storage and Search**: Elasticsearch
- **Data Collection**: requests library for API interactions
- **Logging**: Custom logging utility for improved traceability
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose to simplify setup and deployment
- **Testing**: Pytest for automated testing and quality assurance
